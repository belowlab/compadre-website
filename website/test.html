    Nightman, sneaky and mean</br>
    Spider inside my dreams, I think I love you</br>
    You make me wanna cry</br>
    You make me wanna die</br>
    I love you</br>
    I love you</br>
    I love you</br>
    I love you, nightman</br>
    Every night you come into my room</br>
    and pin me down</br>
    with your strong arms</br>
    you pin me down</br>
    and I try to fight you</br>
    you come inside me</br>
    you fill me up and I become the Nightman</br></br>
    
    It's just two men sharing the night</br>
    It might seem wrong</br>
    But it's just right!</br>
    It's just two men sharing each other</br>
    It's just two men like loving brothers</br>
    One on top and one on bottom</br>
    One inside and one is out</br>
    One is screaming he's so happy</br>
    The other's screaming a passionate shout</br></br>
    
    It's the Nightman</br>
    The feelings so wrong and right, man</br>
    They're feeling so wrong and right, man</br></br>
    
    I can't fight you, man</br>
    When you come inside me</br>
    And pin me down with your strong hands</br>
    And I become The Night</br>
    The passionly passionate Nightman</br></br></br></br>

    Stage freeze!
