    Nightman, sneaky and mean
    Spider inside my dreams, I think I love you
    You make me wanna cry
    You make me wanna die
    I love you
    I love you
    I love you
    I love you, nightman
    Every night you come into my room
    and pin me down
    with your strong arms
    you pin me down
    and I try to fight you
    you come inside me
    you fill me up and I become the Nightman
    
    It's just two men sharing the night
    It might seem wrong
    But it's just right!
    It's just two men sharing each other
    It's just two men like loving brothers
    One on top and one on bottom
    One inside and one is out
    One is screaming he's so happy
    The other's screaming a passionate shout
    
    It's the Nightman
    The feelings so wrong and right, man
    They're feeling so wrong and right, man
    
    I can't fight you, man
    When you come inside me
    And pin me down with your strong hands
    And I become The Night
    The passionly passionate Nightman
